1. We are working on separate, branches, we do not push anything to the `main` branch directly, To create your branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
2.  After switching to the new branch, work on yur changes, add modified files to git, commit and push.
    - `git add *`
    - `git commit -m <commit-name>`
    - `git push origin <your-branch-name>`
3. Enter the repository on github and create a Pull Request by assigning at least two people to the code review.
4. Commits message convention: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ 
    - if you add some new feature: "feat(component): commit msg"
    - if you fix something: "fix(comonent): commit msg"
5. To `merge` your branch to the `main`, at least one `approve` is needed.
6. If you have more than one commit on your branch, before merging select `Squash and merge`, remove the description, and confirm the name of your commit.
